# Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I worked on several key projects that demonstrated my skills in data science and machine learning. Below are the details of the projects I completed:

## Projects

### 1. Car Price Prediction

This project involves predicting the selling price of cars based on features like present price, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven. Key steps include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features.
- **Model Building**: Implemented a `RandomForestRegressor` and optimized hyperparameters using `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
- **Visualization**: Compared actual vs. predicted prices using scatter plots.

**Technologies/Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

### 2. Iris Flower Classification

In this project, I developed a classification model to categorize Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements. The project included:

- **Data Exploration**: Used pair plots to visualize the dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Training**: Employed a `RandomForestClassifier` and evaluated it with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzed feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the classification.

**Technologies/Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

### 3. Unemployment Analysis in India

This project focused on analyzing unemployment rates across different regions in India. Key aspects of the project:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and converted date formats.
- **Data Visualization**: Created line plots and scatter plots to visualize unemployment trends and distributions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between unemployment and labor participation rates.
- **Regional Analysis**: Identified top regions with the highest average unemployment and labor participation rates.

**Technologies/Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Internship Experience

My time at Oasis Infobyte allowed me to enhance my technical skills and gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets. I developed expertise in data preprocessing, model building, and data visualization, which has strengthened my capabilities in data science and machine learning.
